# Build It Bigger

Create an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. The finished app will consist
of four modules. 
* A Java library that provides jokes, 
* A Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes, 
* An Android Library containing anactivity for displaying jokes, and 
* An Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.

#Features

* Add free and paid flavors to an app, and set up your build to share code between them
* Factor reusable functionality into a Java library
* Factor reusable Android functionality into an Android library
* Configure a multi project build to compile your libraries and app
* Use the Gradle App Engine plugin to deploy a backend
* Configure an integration test suite that runs against the local App Engine development server
